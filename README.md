# Lazy Deletion Binary Search Tree
A lazy - deletion binary search tree is a binary search tree where erased objects are simply tagged as erased while the nodes themselves remain in the tree.Occasionally, a member function may be called to clean up(delete) all erased nodes at once. Almost all functions will be implemented by calling the corresponding function on the root node.
